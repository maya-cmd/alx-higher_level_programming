This directory contains tasks and instructios on Object Relational Mapping(ORM).

Background Context
In this project, we get to  link two amazing worlds: Databases and Python!

In the first part, we use the module MySQLdb to connect to a MySQL database and execute your SQL queries.

In the second part, we  use the module SQLAlchemy an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).

The biggest difference is: no more SQL queries! Indeed, the purpose of an ORM is to abstract the storage to the usage. With an ORM, the  biggest concern will be “What can I do with my objects” and not “How this object is stored? where? when?”. Here no writing any SQL queries only Python code. Also, code won’t be “storage type” dependent. It's easy to change storage easily without re-writing your entire project.

Without ORM:

conn = MySQLdb.connect(host="localhost", port=3306, user="root", passwd="root", db="my_db", charset="utf8")
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute("SELECT * FROM states ORDER BY id ASC") # HERE I have to know SQL to grab all states in my database
query_rows = cur.fetchall()
for row in query_rows:
    print(row)
cur.close()
conn.close()

With an ORM:

engine = create_engine('mysql+mysqldb://{}:{}@localhost/{}'.format("root", "root", "my_db"), pool_pre_ping=True)
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)

session = Session(engine)
for state in session.query(State).order_by(State.id).all(): # HERE: no SQL query, only objects!
    print("{}: {}".format(state.id, state.name))
session.close()
